<p>Selection tools are used to select features in the vector layers of the web app that allow selection. Two
  selection tools are available: Select by Polygon and Select by Rectangle</p>

<p>If the <i>Select by Polygon</i> tool is active, you can click on the map canvas to define polygon vertices. Close
  the polygon by double-clicking. When the polygon is closed, all features in all selectable layers which are within
  the polygon will get selected. Previous selection, if it exist, will be removed.</p>

<p>If the <i>Select by Rectangle</i> tool is active, you can click and drag to define a rectangle. All features in
  all selectable layers which are within the polygon will get selected. Previous selection, if it exist, will be
  removed.</p>

<p>Selected features will be rendered in a yellow color, to differentiate them from non-selected ones.</p>
