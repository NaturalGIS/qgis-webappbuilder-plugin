<p>The <b>layer</b> drop-down list shows the editable layers in the web app. At the beginning, it will be empty, 
  since app layers are not editable. You have to add your own editable layers, by clicking <b>NEW</b>. The following
  dialog opens.</p>

<p>Enter a name for the layer and select the geometry type in the corresponding fields. You can also select the <b>Fill</b>
  and <b>stroke</b> colors to use when rendering features from this layer.</p>

<p>If you want to add attributes to the layer, enter their names in the <b>Attributes</b> field, separated by commas.
  If you leave that field empty, the layer will only have geometries, and you wont be prompted to enter attribute
  values when a new feature is added.</p>

<p>Close the dialog by clicking <b>CREATE</b> and the new layer will appear in the list of available editable layers.

  the map canvas to add points, lines or polygons, depending on the geometry type of the layer. In the case of lines
  and polygons, double-click to enter the last point of the geometry.</p>

<p>If the layer has attributes defined in its schema, you will be prompted to enter their values</p>
