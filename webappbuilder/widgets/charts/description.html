  can open the chart window by clicking the Chart button in the menu.<p>

<p>In the chart window, select one of the available charts using the Chart Name
  drop-down list</p>

<p>If the layer used by the chart that you have chosen has no selected
  features, you will see an empty chart, as the one shown above. Use any of
  the selection tools to select features. When the selection changes, the
  chart panel is automatically updated, and you will see the chart
  corresponding to the new selection.</p>
