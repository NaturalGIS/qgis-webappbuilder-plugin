<p>Charts can be created based on the selected features of a given layer. You will find the available charts under
  the <i>Charts</i> menu. Select the chart that you want to render and click on it. A panel opens, containing the
  chart canvas.<p>

<p>If the layer that is used by the chart that you chose has no selected features, you will see an empty chart, as
  shown above. Use any of the selection tools to select features. When the selection changes, the chart panel is
  automatically updated, and you will see the chart corresponding to the new selection.</p>
